 # üìÇ **Prophet Time Series Price Commodity**

## üìö *Introduction*
This project focuses on analyzing avocado pricing trends using time series analysis and forecasting techniques. Avocado prices exhibit a clear seasonal pattern, with prices typically rising in the summer and falling in the winter. By applying Prophet, a powerful forecasting model, we are able to identify and quantify the seasonal and trend components in the historical price data. This approach allows for a more accurate prediction of future price movements.

The project also explores regional differences, specifically in the U.S. market, where avocado pricing trends vary by region. While the national trend indicates a decline in prices, the West Region is expected to experience an upward price trajectory, illustrating the importance of considering regional dynamics in forecasting.

## üìù *Summary* 
Our analysis reveals a clear seasonal pattern in avocado pricing, with prices rising in the summer and falling in the winter. While national trends suggest a general price decline, the West Region is expected to see a price increase despite similar seasonal fluctuations. The dataset is balanced across regions, though incomplete for certain years, and the predictions align with the observed seasonal trends.
